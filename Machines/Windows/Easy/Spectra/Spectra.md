// Navigating to http://10.10.10.229/ , get us to webpage with that declares on issue with jira configurations

// And there are 2 redirection links

![Image 1](https://github.com/W0lfySec/HTB-Writeups/blob/main/Images/Spectra/1.png)

- First navigae to: http://spectra.htb/main/index.php

- Second navigates to: http://spectra.htb/testing/index.php

// So first i add spectra.htb to /etc/hosts

    $cat /etc/hosts
    # Host addresses
    10.10.10.229 spectra.htb

// Then i navigated back to http://spectra.htb/main/index.php

![Image 2](https://github.com/W0lfySec/HTB-Writeups/blob/main/Images/Spectra/2.png)

// There i could see that the website cms is Wordpress and user 'administrator' exist

// Also there is 'Log in' Button that redirect us to /wp-login.php (wordpress login page)

// After that i decided to run [WPScan](https://wpscan.com/wordpress-security-scanner) to check for more options

    $ wpscan --url http://spectra.htb/main/

// The most interesting thing for me was the version 

    [+] WordPress version 5.4.2 identified 

// So i searched online for vulnerabillities([Source1](https://www.tenable.com/plugins/was/112479), [Source2](https://wpscan.com/wordpress/54))

// and the most spoken vulnerabillity for that version is [XSS attack](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/)

// Earlier in the first page(http://10.10.10.229/) we had the second link that redirects us to http://spectra.htb/testing/index.php

![Image 2.1](https://github.com/W0lfySec/HTB-Writeups/blob/main/Images/Spectra/2.1.png)

// Since this version of Wordpress vulnerable to XSS, i tried to navigate to http://spectra.htb/testing/

// And it worked !

![Image 5](https://github.com/W0lfySec/HTB-Writeups/blob/main/Images/Spectra/5.png)

// We navigated to /testing folder with wordpress configuration files

// Checking the files what mostly catched my eye was 'wp-config.php' but it is blank page 

// But, when i opened 'wp-config.php.save' and view the source-page i was able to see Mysql creds in the notes

![Image 6](https://github.com/W0lfySec/HTB-Writeups/blob/main/Images/Spectra/6.png)

    // ** MySQL settings - You can get this info from your web host ** //
    /** The name of the database for WordPress */
    define( 'DB_NAME', 'dev' );

    /** MySQL database username */
    define( 'DB_USER', 'devtest' );

    /** MySQL database password */
    define( 'DB_PASSWORD', 'devteam01' );

// So now that i have MySQL credentials and port 3306(mysql) is open 

// I tried to connect to the database

    $ mysql -h spectra.htb -P 3306 -u devtest --password=devteam01
    ERROR 1130 (HY000): Host '10.10.16.2' is not allowed to connect to this MySQL server

// But it didnt work... moving on!

// perhaps, moving back! i moved back to wp-login page and tried to connect with user 'administrator'(That we see in http://spectra.htb/main/)

// With the databse password 'devteam01' , And it worked !!!

![Image 7](https://github.com/W0lfySec/HTB-Writeups/blob/main/Images/Spectra/7.png)

// Searching where i could injection to a php script, i found option to at: 'Apperance' -> 'Theme Editor'

// And tried to edit the '404 page', But when tried to Upload the file i got ERROR

![Image 10](https://github.com/W0lfySec/HTB-Writeups/blob/main/Images/Spectra/10.png)

// So again to the search i notice another interesting location at: 'Plugins' -> 'Plugin Editor' 

// There we have permissions to edit akismet/akismet.php file 

// and using this [source](https://www.acunetix.com/blog/articles/web-shells-101-using-php-introduction-web-shells-part-2/) i inject value cmd that it basically a web-shell
